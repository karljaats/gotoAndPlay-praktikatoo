## Instructions
Simply open index.html in your browser of choice.

## How it went
The whole thing took me about 12 hours of work, which I think is pretty good considering that I had no experience with JavaScript previously.

The solution uses Typescript with a Canvas. In addition to the automatic fireworks you can also click to produce multicolored firework explosions.

I did originally have the different classes in different files to improve readability but ran into problems with it. 
I couldn't find a way to get the exporting/importing to work without installing some extra tools and/or running the 
solution on a local server. As the deadline was also nearing, I decided to move all the TypeScript code into one file.

Overall it was a nice project to do as doing that sort of little fun projects is what got me into programming in the first place, and I had almost forgotten how much I enjoyed doing them.
